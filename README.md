# Tinnitus-n-Sleep
Detecting events in sleeping tinnitus patients


## Installation
The following steps must be performed on a Anaconda prompt console, or 
alternatively, in a Windows command console that has executed the 
`C:\Anaconda3\Scripts\activate.bat` command that initializes the `PATH` so that
the `conda` command is found.

1. Checkout this repository and change to the cloned directory
   for the following steps.

    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:lkorczowski/Tinnitus-n-Sleep.git
    $ cd Tinnitus-n-Sleep
    ```
    
2. Create a virtual environment with all dependencies.

    ```
    $ conda env create -f environment.yaml
    ```
    
3. Activate the environment and install this package (optionally with the `-e` 
    flag).

    ```
    $ conda activate tinnsleep-env
    $ pip install -e .
    ```
