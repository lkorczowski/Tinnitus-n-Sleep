## The Roadmap: what should we do?

The Roadmap is a ever changing document that allow anyone to understand exactly the following questions:
- what should be done?
- how this should be done?
- what is the priority?
- who does what?

The two mains components in the roadmap are the `features` and the `tasks`.

For the roadmap to be efficient, it requires to use several technical resources, such as `git` workflow and the
 proper use of GitHub Pull-Requests, Code review, Issues, and the implementation of Continuous Integration
 tools.
 
The result is a satisfying git workflow where each merge can be tracked to a efficient execution of a roadmap, e.g.
